    "overviewDescription": "The MSP-EXP430FR2311 LaunchPad Development Kit is an easy-to-use microcontroller development board for the MSP430FR2311 MCU. It contains everything needed to start developing quickly on the MSP430FR2x FRAM platform, including on-board emulation for programming, debugging and Energy Measurements. The board features on-board buttons and LEDs for integration of a simple user interface and a Optical Sensor interface to get started with your development. The kit comes with a  pre-programmed code for testing the light intensity and use of integrated Op-Amp. The MSP430FR2311 microcontroller features embedded FRAM (Ferroelectric Random Access Memory), a non-volatile memory known for its ultra-low power, high endurance and high-speed write capabilities. The device also has integrated Smart Analog Features ( integrated Op-Amp, Comparator, DAC and ADC ) to help connect a variety of industrial sensors enabling single chip implementation for most sensing applications. Rapid prototyping is a snap thanks to 20-pin headers and a wide range of BoosterPack plug-in modules enabling technologies such as wireless connectivity, graphical displays, environmental sensing, and much more.",
